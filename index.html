<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>

<p>My name is Sam and I am pursuing my Master's degree in Scientific and Technial Communication.</p>

<p>I am employed by the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<h2>My Interests</h2>

<p>When I'm not reading for school or enveloped in coursework, I enjoy watching film and playing video games with friends.</p>

<p>Currently, I am reading <i>All the President's Men</i> by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein for my book club. In what free time remains, I am also playing through <i>Untitled Goose Game</i> and <i>Picross 3D</i>.</p>

<h2>My Experience with Code</h2>

<p>I previously worked as a Digital Editor at a magazine conglomerate known as MSP Communications. This job provided me with experience overseeing a content mangement system (CMS), which required some HTML knowledge. However, I am largely unfamiliar with other coding languages, such as CSS and Javascript.</p>
